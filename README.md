# Intro-to-Visualisation
# 🎨 Exploration of Visualisations in Tableau and Power BI 📊

## Overview 🌍

Welcome to my data visualisation playground! 🎢 In this project, I dive into the world of **Tableau** and **Power BI**, exploring how to turn raw data into stunning visual insights. 🕵️‍♂️ From analysing sales data in the **Sample Superstore** to uncovering storytelling power with the **Hollywood Most Profitable Stories** dataset, these dashboards tell stories that speak louder than numbers! 📈✨

## 🚀 Workflow

Here’s the data journey I followed for all projects:

1. **Import Data 📥**  
   Bring the data into Tableau and Power BI and get ready for the magic to happen!

2. **Set Relationships 🔗**  
   Link tables or fields like a matchmaker, ensuring all data connects perfectly. 💌

3. **Check Data Types 🛠**  
   Fix those pesky columns—dates should be dates, numbers should be numbers (no imposters allowed!). 🕶

4. **Handle Missing Values 🔍**  
   Either fill in the blanks or send incomplete data packing! No missing values can hold me back. 💪

5. **Build Charts 📊**  
   Create awesome visualisations—bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, you name it! 🎯

6. **Create Dashboards 🖥**  
   Combine all the charts into a dashboard that’s as insightful as it is interactive. Click, explore, learn! 🔥
